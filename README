congif
======

This is  an experimental tool  that generates GIF animations  of console
sessions.  Like  scriptreplay(1),  it  reads the  output  of  script(1),
including timing information. Unlike  scriptreplay(1), congif parses the
session dialogue and encodes it as a GIF animation that can be viewed on
graphical programs (e.g. web browsers).


Limitations
-----------

Only dialogues generated  for the Linux console can  be correctly parsed
by congif.  This means that  if your  $TERM environment variable  is not
"linux" then  it probably won't  work. You  can manually set  $TERM when
calling script(1), but  then your terminal may not  work correctly while
the session is recorded. It's  recommended that you record your sessions
on  the  Linux  console  itself,  or on  a  terminal  emulator  that  is
compatible with console_codes(4).

congif needs  to know  the terminal  size used  during the  execution of
script(1) and this size must be constant per session (i.e. if you resize
the terminal while recording a  session, congif won't work). By default,
congif assumes  that the terminal  size of the  session is equal  to the
current terminal size. Use the options -w  and -h if you need to specify
a different size.


Building
--------

A C99 compiler is needed. There are no library dependencies.

$ make


Usage
-----

congif [OPTIONS] timings dialogue

    timings:       File generated by script(1)'s -t option
    dialogue:      File generated by script(1)'s regular output

    OPTIONS:
      -w columns   Terminal width
      -h lines     Terminal height
      -f font      File name of MBF font to use
      -o output    File name of GIF output
      -d divisor   Speedup, as in scriptreplay(1)
      -m maxdelay  Maximum delay, as in scriptreplay(1)
      -c on|off    Show/hide cursor
      -v           Verbose mode


Fonts
-----

For  simplicity, congif  uses a  custom font  format, MBF.  The font  UW
ttyp0 [1], included in this distribution, is used by default.


Examples
--------

Recording a session:
$ script -t 2> foo.t foo.d

Generating a GIF file with defaults (creates "con.gif"):
$ congif foo.t foo.d

Generating a faster version:
$ congif -d3 -m1 -o fast.gif foo.t foo.d
